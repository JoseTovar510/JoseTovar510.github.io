<h2><font color="white">
<p>My video was focused on soccer. I pretty much have been playing soccer all my life which motivated me to make a creation for my love fo the sport. Throughout the video, I used multiple effects and transitions. Some of the video effects that I used was the Gaussian Blur, Cross Dissolve transition, and the green screen. Most of the videos used on the project were from ‘video pixels’ except or the green screen. I was also trying to make the video a bit humorous which is why I left the ball in place when I was supposed to be juggling it in the air during the green screen effect. The music used in the video was meant to give off an energetic/ goofy vibe at the same time.</p></font></h2>
