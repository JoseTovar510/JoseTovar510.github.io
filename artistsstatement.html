  I come from a city known as Oakland. Oakland is a place filled with a lot of art and diversity, filled with places to explore. This city has shaped me who I am and I want to appreciate it by showing the beauty of the city through my artwork. During my time in Art 75, I feel like I was able to show a lot of what I personally like to see from Oakland, which includes nature, points of interest, and the urban setting overall. I enjoyed showing my hometown in my artwork and plan on doing so again in the near future. I really care about putting my hometown on the map because it’s done a lot for me and it deserves the recognition that the media doesn’t give and misinterprets such as saying the city is a ghetto place filled with crime. I enjoy working with landscapes and man made buildings that are strikingly beautiful but also want to recognize the small hidden gems that aren’t so obvious. My drone will hopefully help me find these gems and give me the bird’s eye view that I don’t have here in the ground. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   I never really tell anyone but I enjoy traveling a lot. I want to make that seem obvious in my artwork, showing the highlights of the travel experience. This is a key point in my artwork since it showed more of a travel aspect with all the exploring involved, whether it be in the Oakland hills trails or the big points of interest such as the Coliseum. I have done work in the past involving edited videos of my travel so I feel like that was a huge inspiration in my work for the class. Traveling is one of my favorite things to do so I hope that I'll be able to shoot more and show the beauty of the world in my artwork soon.
